# K2 Lab RunPod

K2 Lab RunPod is the independently installable browser application and remote GPU runtime
for K2 Region Lab workflows. It contains the React studio, FastAPI control plane, RunPod
provisioning backend, authenticated workspace agent, and the shared generation engine needed
inside the GPU image. It does not contain the PySide6/QML desktop application.

The web implementation was separated from
[`soomrenald/krea_region_project`](https://github.com/soomrenald/krea_region_project) at desktop
source commit `2af341c5406b10f3028e65bf43de514d55a24fff`.

## Current milestone

The exact equivalence boundary with the local application is tracked in
[`docs/web_desktop_parity.md`](docs/web_desktop_parity.md). RunPod image publication is
blocked until every non-excluded acceptance row is complete and confirmed.

Implemented:

- FastAPI workspace contracts and lifecycle endpoints;
- a safe in-memory development backend that never calls or bills RunPod;
- account connection, ordered GPU preferences, cloud type, storage, idle timeout, cost
  review, workspace creation, stop/start, lease extension, and typed deletion UX;
- the Generate, Edit, and Faces workspace shell;
- local PNG/JPEG/WebP loading for interface development;
- separate image-edit reference and target layers;
- SVG region drawing, selection, movement, and live eight-direction resizing;
- complete version-18 prompt, region, phrase-emphasis, character/standard LoRA routing,
  seed/batch, regional-guidance, image-edit, face, projector, and post-upscale controls;
- exact front-to-back region priority and subject/background-role serialization plus a unified
  prompt preview compiled by the same Python implementation as the legacy desktop;
- prompt editors with overflow scrollbars and live state synchronization;
- responsive desktop/mobile styling with locally bundled fonts;
- New/Open/Import PNG/Save/Save As project workflows, keyboard shortcuts, exact version-18
  browser round trips, persistent cloud project copies, and cloud source restoration;
- deterministic diffusion-model, text-encoder, VAE, face-detector, LoRA, and upscaler
  selection from persistent workspace inventory, plus a safe configurable output prefix;
- automatic local-image upload, authenticated input/output/project previews and downloads,
  source replacement/clearing, and latest-output reuse;
- remote face detection with numbered selectable proposals, select all/none, multiple manual
  lassos, undo/clear, and exact refinement payloads;
- a chronological 1,000-entry rolling event log and explicit worker-memory release control.
- a production RunPod REST/GraphQL adapter with redacted provider errors;
- encrypted process-local credential storage and explicit production backend selection;
- live GPU inventory/pricing plans and persistent-Pod create/start/stop/delete requests.
- a separate versioned workspace-agent image with authenticated health, capabilities,
  storage validation, and idempotent persistent-layout initialization.
- durable cloud-file inventory, checksum-verified resumable uploads, duplicate detection,
  and authenticated ranged output retrieval;
- an Assets panel with streaming SHA-256 hashing, pause/resume/retry/cancel controls,
  transfer progress, throughput, and ETA.
- provider-side Civitai and Hugging Face inspection/download jobs with encrypted
  least-privilege tokens, strict URL/redirect validation, resumable Civitai ranges,
  Hugging Face cache reuse, unsafe-format confirmation, and safetensors validation.
- generation, image-edit, and face-refinement jobs using the canonical project document,
  durable summaries/events, cursor-based reconnect, cancellation, progress display, and
  authenticated output retrieval through opaque file IDs; explicit tensor-manifest validation,
  accelerator diagnostics, LoRA compatibility inspection, memory-policy controls, and live
  hardware telemetry are intentionally omitted from the browser parity boundary.
- persistent-Pod and portable-workspace onboarding, RunPod datacenter/network-volume
  inventory, compatible GPU filtering, independent storage pricing, and ephemeral Pod
  termination/recreation around a retained network volume.
- sealed allowlisted workspace manifests, resumable checksum-verified persistent-to-portable
  copy, durable reconnectable migration progress, manifest-gated switchover, and separate
  typed confirmation before deleting the stopped original Pod.

Not yet implemented:

- a cloud-KMS adapter (the production vault currently uses a persisted Fernet root key);
- a published and signed CUDA workspace image (the build definition and agent are present);
- multi-account tenancy or a hosted deployment.

The development backend is labelled throughout the UI. Its generation buttons are
disabled so it cannot be confused with a connected GPU worker.

## RunPod backend

The default development command uses the non-billing development backend. The real RunPod
backend must be selected explicitly and requires an immutable runtime image plus a Fernet
encryption key:

### Personal computer: one-command launcher

From a checkout, the recommended single-user path is:

```bash
./scripts/k2lab-runpod \
  --image 'ghcr.io/OWNER/k2lab-runpod-workspace@sha256:64_HEX_DIGEST'
```

The launcher uses `uv` to install the web dependencies when needed. It generates a persistent
Fernet key, creates a SQLite control-plane database, serves the bundled React interface and API
at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, and opens the browser. The image digest is saved, so subsequent runs
are just:

```bash
./scripts/k2lab-runpod
```

By default, configuration, encrypted credentials, workspace records, and provider-resource
mappings are stored under `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/k2-region-lab`. Use `--state-dir`
to select another private directory, `--port` to change the loopback port, or `--no-open` to
leave the browser closed. Back up `credential.key` together with `state.sqlite3`; losing the key
makes the stored RunPod credential unreadable.

Local mode is intentionally bound to `127.0.0.1`, disables proxy-header trust, rejects
non-loopback clients and unrecognized Host headers, and requires a same-origin browser for
mutations. Do not forward or publicly proxy its port. The workspace image must be public and
must contain this repository's versioned agent. The release workflow in
`.github/workflows/workspace-image.yml` publishes that image when a version tag is pushed; copy
the resulting GHCR `image@sha256:digest` value into the first-run command. Until an image has
actually been published, there is no valid default digest to embed safely.

After the browser opens, create a restricted user-owned RunPod key, paste it into **RunPod
account**, and choose **Validate and continue**. Select a Persistent Pod or portable network
volume, order the GPU fallbacks, set the storage and idle timeout, review the cost, and create
the workspace. This can create billable resources.

### Hosted deployment

```bash
export K2LAB_WEB_BACKEND=runpod
export K2LAB_CREDENTIAL_FERNET_KEY="<persisted-secret-from-your-KMS-bootstrap>"
export K2LAB_DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://k2lab:<password>@<host>/k2lab"
export K2LAB_RUNPOD_IMAGE_DIGEST="registry.example/k2lab@sha256:<64-hex-digest>"
export K2LAB_RUNPOD_IMAGE_VERSION="0.1.0"
export K2LAB_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://studio.example.com"
export K2LAB_AUTH_ALLOWED_SUBJECT="<stable-subject-from-your-identity-provider>"
export K2LAB_TRUSTED_PROXY_SECRET="<random-secret-at-least-32-characters>"
uv run k2lab-web
```

Generate the Fernet value once with `Fernet.generate_key()`, store it in a secret manager,
and reuse it after every restart. Rotating or losing it makes existing provider credentials
unreadable. SQLite (`sqlite+aiosqlite:////absolute/path`) is supported for isolated local
tests, while PostgreSQL is the production store.

The RunPod backend refuses to start without the hosted security settings above. Deploy it
behind a TLS authentication proxy that removes all inbound `X-K2-*` headers, completes
identity-provider login/MFA, and then injects `X-K2-Authenticated-User`,
`X-K2-Authenticated-MFA: true`, and `X-K2-Proxy-Secret` on the session-bootstrap request.
The allowed subject makes this deployment single-account by design. The control plane then
uses a rotating opaque `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` browser session plus a
double-submit CSRF token, strict Origin checks, request bounds, and endpoint-class rate
limits. Do not expose the Uvicorn port directly to the internet.

This mode can create billable Pods. Workspace records, leases, encrypted credentials,
provider-resource mappings, the operation-journal schema, and redacted audit events are
durable. Startup reconciliation refreshes known Pod state, and a background reaper stops
compute after lease expiry. The Pod remains in `starting` until the versioned workspace
image and authenticated agent are available.

Browser uploads currently pass through the authenticated control plane to the workspace
agent. Upload manifests and completed chunks live on the persistent workspace volume, so
an interrupted browser transfer can query the session and send only missing chunks.
Provider downloads run inside the workspace, so large model files do not pass through the
browser or control plane. Provider tokens are encrypted at rest and are forwarded in an
agent request header for one operation; they are not written into transfer records.

Remote runs start an isolated line-delimited worker process and send the same versioned
project data used by the local application. The agent persists redacted job events on the
workspace volume, while the control plane persists job summaries and reconnectable event
cursors. Raw filesystem paths, prompts, and credentials are excluded from those events;
completed images are returned through authenticated opaque output URLs with HTTP Range
support.

Every browser run is first parsed as a version-18 project and compiled by the shared Python
unified-prompt implementation. Invalid emphasis matches, LoRA scopes/triggers, duplicate region
names, or out-of-canvas geometry fail before a GPU job is submitted. **Preview unified prompt**
shows the exact compiled text and resolved front-to-back subject/background order.

Migration temporarily bills both source and target compute plus both storage resources.
Closing the browser does not discard progress: reopen the workspace, choose the migration
action, and resume from the last accepted chunk. Explicit **Stop GPU now** aborts an active
migration, terminates its temporary target Pod, unseals the source, and retains the target
network volume. A manifest mismatch also leaves the original workspace authoritative and
retains the network volume for inspection. The application never automatically deletes a
network volume. See [`docs/runpod_workspace_operations.md`](docs/runpod_workspace_operations.md)
for the lifecycle and recovery runbook.

## Local development

Install the Python and browser dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --extra web
cd web/client
npm install
```

Run the control plane from the repository root:

```bash
uv run k2lab-web --reload
```

In a second terminal, run the Vite client:

```bash
cd web/client
npm run dev
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5173>. Vite proxies `/api` to
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`. In development mode, any test key containing at least eight
characters passes the simulated credential check. Do not use a real provider credential
with the development backend.

## Validation

```bash
uv run pytest -q tests/test_web_control_plane.py
cd web/client
npm run build
```

The production bundle is written to the ignored `web/client/dist/` directory.

The ordinary suite never provisions a Pod. A destructive live acceptance test exists for
a dedicated disposable RunPod account and remains skipped unless every required variable
and this exact sentinel are provided:

```bash
export K2LAB_RUNPOD_LIVE_TESTS=I_ACCEPT_BILLING_AND_DELETION
export K2LAB_RUNPOD_API_KEY='<restricted disposable-account key>'
export K2LAB_RUNPOD_IMAGE_DIGEST='registry.example/k2lab@sha256:<digest>'
export K2LAB_RUNPOD_TEST_GPU='<supported GPU ID>'
uv run pytest -q tests/test_runpod_live_acceptance.py
```

The live suite covers both a billable persistent Pod and a portable network-volume workspace.
It verifies upload persistence across persistent stop/start and verifies an allowlisted SHA-256
manifest across portable Pod termination/recreation. Cleanup permanently deletes every test Pod
and the explicitly tracked disposable network volume.
